You can start with the easier ones and gradually work your way up. Plus, they usually have good facilities and maps.4. **Urban Trails**: If you live near a city, urban trails can be a great way to start.

If you're near any national or state parks, they often have great options. For example, if you have a local park with a nature reserve, those trails are usually well-maintained and not too strenuous. One of my favorite beginner trails is the **Blue Ridge Parkway** in Virginia. It offers stunning views and has several easy trails like the **Humpback Rocks** trail. Another great option is the **Griffith Park** in Los Angeles, which has a variety of trails suitable for all levels. Do you have any specific areas in mind where you’d like to start hiking?",
